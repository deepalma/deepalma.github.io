# CT 1.2: What is a category?
The best tools in our intellectual arsenal are: abstraction, composition and identity.
When we abstract from unnecessary details, things that were different suddenly become identical. That means that identity is very important and that, because of abstraction, is always non trivial.
Composition and Identity defines category theory.
A Category is defined by some objects and some morphism (or arrows).
A morphism is something that goes from one object to another object.
An object is a primitive in CT and has no properties.
Also morphisms are primitives with the only property that every arrow has a beginning and an end.
The only purpose for objects is being markers for the ends of the morphisms.

When we reason in a categorical way, we forget about the structure of the objects and we define all the properties we need in term of morphisms.
### Composition
If we have a morphism $$ f $$ between $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ and a morphism $$ g $$ between $$ b $$ and $$ c $$,  in order to have a category we should be able to compose the two morphisms in a morphism $$ g \circ f $$ that goes from $$ a $$ to $$ c $$. From a categorical perspective going from $$ a $$ to $$ c $$ via $$ f $$ and $$ g $$ identical as going via $$ g \circ f $$.

![composition of morphism]({{site.baseurl}}/diagrams/svg/2.svg?style=centerme)

For every composable path the composition morphism must be defined.
Composition can be thougth as a multiplication n-dimensional table: for every two, three, four, etcâ€¦ arrows there is a composition. The whole information about a category is in this multiplication table.
### Identity
For every object in a category there is an identity arrow.
The identity is needed to satisfy the composition law.
in terms of composition the neutral element: $$ id \circ f = f $$ (left identity) and $$ f \circ id = f $$ (right identity)

Another law that must be respected is associativity: $$ h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f $$.

### Side notes
There are some studies were associativity is weakened and it is considered up to an isomorphism.
In general object in a category non form a set (large category). If they form a set the category is name small.
Morphisms instead form a set (otherwise we are in Higher Category Theory).
A  Group is a Monoid that also has an inverse.
If you create a category where every arrow has an inverse then you have a Groupoid. A Grupoid is not a Group. A Group is made of a single oblect and you can compose everything with everything. A Groupoid contains many objects that in order to be composable need to have morphism with matching ends.

### Programming
An example of a category in programming is a category where the objects are Types and the morphisms are Functions. Ad example ML or Haskell.
Types in a programming language are Sets of values.
A mathematical function is defined between Sets.
